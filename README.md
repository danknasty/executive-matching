# Executive-Job Matching System Overview

Our Executive-Job Matching System is an advanced solution that utilizes cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning algorithms, and AI services to intelligently match executive profiles with job descriptions. By incorporating semantic analysis, skill expansion, and AI-powered similarity scoring, the system provides a comprehensive matching score that aids organizations in making informed hiring decisions.

## Key Components of the Matching System

### 1. Data Input and Extraction

- **Executive Profile**:
  - *Biography*: Detailed narrative of the executive's professional journey.
  - *Education*: Academic qualifications, degrees obtained, and fields of study.
  - *Experience*: Work history including roles, responsibilities, and durations.
  - *Skills*: List of competencies and proficiencies.
  
- **Job Description**:
  - *Responsibilities*: Core duties associated with the position.
  - *Required Skills*: Specific skills and expertise needed.
  - *Experience Requirement*: Minimum years of experience.
  - *Education Requirement*: Minimum educational qualifications.

### 2. Text Preprocessing

- **Normalization**: Converting text to lowercase for consistency.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- **Stopword Removal**: Eliminating common words that do not add significant meaning.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms.

### 3. Skill Expansion

- **Synonym Expansion**: Utilizing WordNet to find synonyms, enhancing the skill set.
- **Taxonomy Expansion**: Leveraging a predefined skill taxonomy to include related and parent skills.
- **AI-Powered Expansion**: Using OpenAI's GPT-based models to suggest additional relevant skills.

### 4. Semantic Similarity Calculation

- **Sentence Embeddings**: Generating numerical representations of text using pre-trained models like SentenceTransformer.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computing the similarity between the executive's profile and the job description.

\text{Semantic Similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec{E} \cdot \vec{J}}{\|\vec{E}\| \|\vec{J}\|}
" />

where:

- $\vec{E}$ = Embedding vector of the executive's profile.
- $\vec{J}$ = Embedding vector of the job description.

### 5. Skill Matching with Weighted Importance

- **Skill Extraction**: Identifying skills in the job description using advanced NLP techniques like EntityRuler and PhraseMatcher.
- **Importance Weighting**: Assigning weights to skills based on their frequency and position in the job description.
- **Weighted Skill Similarity**: Calculating a similarity score that accounts for the importance of each skill.

\text{Skill Similarity} = \frac{\sum_{s \in S_E} \left( w(s) \cdot \delta(s \in S_J) \right)}{\sum_{s \in S_J} w(s)}
" />

where:

- $S_E$ = Set of executive's expanded skills.
- $S_J$ = Set of job's required skills with importance weights.
- $w(s)$ = Importance weight of skill $s$ in the job description.
- $\delta(s \in S_J)$ = Indicator function (1 if $s$ matches a job skill, 0 otherwise).

### 6. Experience Evaluation

- **Total Experience Calculation**: Summing the durations of all positions held by the executive.
- **Experience Similarity**:

\text{Experience Similarity} = \min\left( \frac{\text{Executive Experience Years}}{\text{Job Required Experience Years}},\ 1.0 \right)
" />

### 7. Education Alignment

- **Education Level Mapping**: Assigning numerical levels to degrees (e.g., Bachelor's = 2, Master's/MBA = 3, Doctorate = 4).
- **Education Similarity**:

<img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%0A%5Ctext%7BEducation%20Similarity%7D%20%3D%20%0A%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A1.0%2C%20%26%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20%5Ctext%7BExecutive%20Education%20Level%7D%20%5Cgeq%20%5Ctext%7BJob%20Education%20Level%7D%20%5C%5C%0A0.0%2C%20%26%20%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A" alt="
\text{Education Similarity} = 
\begin{cases}
1.0, &amp; \text{if } \text{Executive Education Level} \geq \text{Job Education Level} \\
0.0, &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
" />

### 8. AI-Powered Similarity Scoring

- **OpenAI GPT Integration**: Using GPT-based models to compute an additional similarity score by comparing the executive's profile and the job description in natural language.
- **OpenAI Similarity Score**: Obtained directly from the AI model, providing an insightful measure of compatibility.

## Total Matching Score Calculation

The final matching score combines all similarity metrics with predefined weights, reflecting their relative importance.

" />

where the weights $w_1$ to $w_5$ are set based on organizational priorities (e.g., $w_1 = 0.2$, $w_2 = 0.25$, $w_3 = 0.25$, $w_4 = 0.05$, $w_5 = 0.25$).
